    description: 'Techdirt is an online publication that serves approximately 500,000 unique visitors each month. In addition to being a publishing platform and content management system, the site offers community engagement features such as commenting, comment rating, and story submissions, which are available to all users. Users can also register to enable additional features, and purchase membership subscriptions to access premium features like early access to unpublished posts and a chat that connects them directly to the staff and other subscibers. Features are built leveraging technologies like vanilla JavaScript, jQuery, and REST APIs, with a PHP/MySQL back end. As Techdirt\'s primary (and often sole) software developer, I have been responsible for building and maintaining nearly all of the pieces of the custom platform on which Techdirt runs.',
