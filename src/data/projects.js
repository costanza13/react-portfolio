    description: 'Techdirt is an online publication that serves approximately 500,000 unique visitors each month. In addition to being a publishing platform and content management system, the site offers community engagement features such as commenting, comment rating, and story submissions, which are available to all visitors. Users can also register to enable additional features, and purchase membership subscriptions to access premium perks like early access to unpublished posts and a chat that connects them directly to the staff and other subscibers. Most features are built leveraging technologies like vanilla JavaScript, jQuery, and REST APIs, with a PHP/MySQL back end. As Techdirt\'s primary (and often sole) software developer, I have been responsible for building and maintaining nearly all of the pieces of the custom platform on which Techdirt runs.',

    description: 'Cool California was created to help California adventurers discover incredible places in California. The current version of the application is intended to serve as the basis for a social network to let people with similar interests share descriptions, tips & tricks, and useful information about the places they love. The app provides like/dislike functionality, tagging (of both places and the users themselves), and filters to help users zero in on destinations they may enjoy visiting. I was able to apply my prior experience with MySQL to structure the database, and used Express to handle and route requests made to the server. The app leverages the MVC pattern, using Handlebars for the views, and Sequelize (ORM) for the models.',
